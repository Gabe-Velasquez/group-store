# group-store
Created this repo for students to practice forking, committing, and pushing in a group setting. Practice pull requests and resolve any merge issues like a team setting does daily. All that and to potentially have something on a professional portfolio. 


Have a couple of ground rules that should be simple to follow: 

1. Do not harass anyone that contributes. This is a learning environment and people make mistakes. 

2. Put this together in hopes students will use it as professional work. With that being said, please do not put NSFW (Not Safe For Work) material on the main branch. 

3. Practice writing clean code and leave comments what code does. It will help others learn. 

4. Keep a positve attitude and have FUN! 


If you have any questions or anything, send me a message on discord (GabeV#7963) and let's chat!
